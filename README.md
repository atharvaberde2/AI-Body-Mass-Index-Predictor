# AI-Body-Mass-Index-Predictor
The AI Body Mass Index (BMI) Predictor is a machine learning project designed to estimate an individual's BMI using machine learning. It predicts an individual's BMI through their Height, Weight, and Gender.  Various machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, pipeline of Polynomial features and RandomForest, and Gradient Boosting, were tested, with the pipeline of Polynomial features and RandomForest performing the best, achieving an accuracy of 0.90 on the test set, and a mean accuracy of 0.86 through Stratified K Fold.
